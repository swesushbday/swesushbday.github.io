        <p>"Back in 6th grade, right after I'd moved to India, I remember walking into the 6D classroom on the first day. I was extremely nervous, dressed in a small pleated skirt and I had a strong British accent so everyone stared at me. After accidentally going to the boy's side of the room, I finally sat down in last bench girls side and when I looked to my left there was a fair, tall girl who smiled at me- Sush. Little did I know that she'd become my very first best friend at CPS, someone I'd come to tell everything to and have a lot of laughs with. She was a sensitive albeit thoughtful, loyal and very smart; and she always had my back, whether it be academic help or personal issues. I'm glad I was blessed to meet and connect with a girl like her. Sush and Swe both are such fun to chat with. People just need to realise that despite how similar the twins look, there personalities are surprisingly so different. Whether it be the mole, the hairstyle or the glasses, the way of speaking, for some reason I've never had trouble telling them apart. I genuinely hope to keep in touch with them for years to come! Happy birthday, Sush and Swe! Though we don't talk often, I'll always know that we can never become strangers because every time we speak, we click all over again!

        <p>  "Birthday come around every year, but friends like you is a life time gift for me. Another year Another challenge my friend. But you need to always remember to keep smiling and have a positive outlook on life and everything is gng to be fine. I hope your birthday is as special as you are. I am looking forward to many more years of friendship and birthday with you. Have a fantastic birthday.
              Let me say a short story....
              A guy who was a total introvert entered clg life...he waa super inferior to all others in clg....his fear toward everything increased tremendously....later he realized the change in him when a spark of three people in his college...which changed his aspect of life...then a beautiful family formed ...named SASK...this is an amazing thing which happened in my college life....i am blessed to have  friends as family....though we had lot of fights and ego problem.....which all made our bond more stronger...I hope this friendship  lasts forever....
              The best gift is the gift of friendship. So that is wat i got you both for your birthday!!
             For many, the word friends is just a sequence of letters.  For me , it is the source of happiness and strength because of you both. Once again happy Happy birthday swe and sush!!!!

There are so many memories to talk about when it comes to us. the first ever memory was PVR which made us more closer, and formed the gang SASK. and from there on it has been not just friendship but a family. first year EG classes were the best and enjoyed the most. the picture I suppose was our first ever pic together. then all the group studies and the funniest memories we have had is just unmatchable. hope our friendship continues forever and the SASK family be together always. again happiest bday guys. have a great day and a wonderful year ahead❤😊. dont forget about the treat😝" - ADITHIYA</p>

        <p>"My fondest memories with Swetha and Sushmita would be the ones we shared in our Microbiology lab in our second year. Lots of deep conversation, constant bickering, loads of pulling each other's legs and some oversharing later, I realised that there was a lot of love to give with the twins. They are innocent, gullible and sweet. My only advice to them would be to be more outgoing with everybody and be more confident of themselves because they're such good people. Cheers and lots of love. P.S I didn't text them during this lockdown, sorry for that and I had only swethas picture on my phone, sorry sush, you're my favourite tho :P. Bye bye!!" - SANTOSH</p>
